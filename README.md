## Overview

The **Mondrian Project** is a web-based design inspired by the abstract art style of Piet Mondrian. Using HTML and CSS, this project recreates a geometric grid layout filled with primary colors and black, much like Mondrian’s famous compositions. The layout is created using CSS Grid, providing a clean and responsive design that mimics the visual style of Mondrian’s art.

This project is part of the **Udemy Web Development Bootcamp** course, where students are tasked with building various projects to apply the concepts learned throughout the course.

## Features

- **Grid Layout**: Utilizes CSS Grid to create a responsive layout with distinct blocks.
- **Colorful Design**: Incorporates Mondrian’s signature colors—red, blue, yellow, black, and white.
- **Simple Implementation**: The project is built purely with HTML and CSS, showcasing how CSS Grid can be used to create geometric art.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To create the structure of the page and define the layout.
- **CSS**: To style the page using CSS Grid, along with specific colors to replicate Mondrian’s abstract style.
